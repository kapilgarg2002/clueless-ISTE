        Our story begins with a house in New Orleans in 1945. But this is no
        ordinary house. It's a super spooky house. And it's nighttime. And it
        looks like it's about to start raining and thundering. Ominous much?<br />
        <br />
        This creepy mansion is run by a butler named Carlos. There's also a maid
        named Rosie and a cook Samuel who loves ominously sharpening knives. One
        by one, guests begin to arrive at the house for a small dinner party.
        Here's the lineup:<br />
        <br />
        * Professor Walph<br />
        * Mrs. Jennifer<br />
        * Mr. Robert<br />
        <br />
        In the middle of dinner, their host, Mr. Victor, arrives.<br />
        It has been revealed during the course of the events that the host Mr.
        Victor has been blackmailing each of the members of the mansion.
        However, during the events, a powerful thunderstorm surges across the
        mansion causing a power outage. In the panic and thunder, the guests
        find that Mr. Victor (host) has been murdered. Police along with a
        detective team is called to investigate the crime scene in order to find
        the killer. However, no one knows who the murderer is and before a
        proper examination of the body can be conducted, the body is confiscated
        from the crime scene with each of the guests now a suspect in Mr.
        Victor's murder. Among them, is a killer who had prepared for the murder
        in advance and is now seeking to escape from the mansion and get away
        with the murder. It's up to the detective team to figure out who is
        guilty before the Killer attempts to escape. Since no evidence was left
        in the room of the murder, the detective team starts their search from
        the basement to find the missing shreds of evidence.
